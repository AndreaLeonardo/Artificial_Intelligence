# TimeTabling Exams_CSP 

Il programma è sviluppano su MiniZinc tramite il Solver Gecode 6.1.1
Esso permette di organizzare in un arco di G giorni gli appelli di E esami ognuno di una durata di ore (2 o 4). La durata può essere facilmente modificabile, ma sarebbe necessario un aggiornamento dei vincoli. Vi sono S studenti che devono essere iscritti o meno agli esami. Questo deve deciderlo l'utente tramite la matrice tabEsami.
Gli esami possono essere svolti in A aule con i rispettivi posti e gli esami possono occupare le aule solo nelle fasce orarie 8:00-12:00 e 14:00-18:00 evitando dunque la pausa pranzo. Ogni studente non può partecipare a più di un esame nello stesso giorno.

Per utilizzare il programma è necessario attribuire alle variabili A, E, G, S, postiAula, durataEsame, tabEsami i valori appropriati per il proprio esempio specifico. Possono essere inseriti i valori direttamente nel codice, oppure tramite le richieste a RunTime (sconsigliato poichè non è comodo inserire vettori o matrici di dati, a meno che non siano preparati in precedenza).

La descrizione del codice è presente nella relazione pdf.
Per ottenere i risultati descritti in fondo alla relazione, i dati da inserire (nella parte contornata da "%") sono i seguenti:
